The Drum Kit project is an interactive web application that allows users to play different drum sounds using both mouse clicks and keyboard presses. 
This application is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
By clicking on drum buttons or pressing specific keys, users can trigger corresponding drum sounds, 
making it a fun and engaging way to simulate playing a drum kit.
